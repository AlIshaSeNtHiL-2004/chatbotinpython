Chatbot with NLTK:
This is a simple chatbot created using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. The chatbot can engage in conversations and respond to specific patterns with predefined responses.
Usage:
* Install the required dependencies:
pip install nltk
* Run the chatbot script:
python chatbot.py
* Start the conversation by typing a greeting like "hi" or "hello."
* You can interact with the chatbot by asking questions or making statements that match the defined patterns.
* Type "bye" to exit the conversation.
Features:
* The chatbot can respond to common greetings and introduce itself.
* It can provide information about its capabilities.
* You can ask for fun facts or its opinion on the best programming language.
* The chatbot is designed to assist and provide recommendations.
Sample Conversations:
* User: "Hi"
* Chatbot: "Hello! How can I help you today?"
* User: "What is your name?"
* Chatbot: "I'm just a simple chatbot. You can call me Chatbot."
* User: "Tell me a fun fact"
* Chatbot: "Sure! Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible."
* User: "What can you do?"
* Chatbot: "I can answer questions, tell jokes, provide information, and engage in conversation with you. How can I assist you today?"
* User: "Thanks"
* Chatbot: "You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask."
* User: "Bye"
* Chatbot: "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
Customization:
You can customize the chatbot by modifying the pattern-response pairs in the pairs list within the script. Add or edit patterns and responses to tailor the chatbot to your needs.
